## About

My personal library for use with Kotlin Multiplatform and Korge that I call **Kiwi**. Lots of the functionality is based off of Deepnights `gameBase` which I've used extensively (and loved) for awhile but just kotlinized.

### Versioning

The version isn't following semver or some sort of structured versioning. I usually just use the latest git code for my projects.
I will occasionally release a version that I deem to be pretty stable. It will most likely have breaking changes.

Use at your own risk :)
